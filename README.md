# MetaCall Core Zig Example

This example shows how to build [MetaCall Core](https://github.com/metacall/core) by using [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) compiler. The example has been developed mainly by [@Deecellar](https://github.com/Deecellar).

## Building

We have used Docker in order to make it reproducible, but it can be built outside of Docker too, just check the commands used in the Dockerfile.

```sh
docker build -t metacall/core-zig-example .
```
